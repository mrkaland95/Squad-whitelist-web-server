[How to add discord OAuth2](https://github.com/discordjs/guide/tree/main/guide/oauth2)

Implement some sort of button that allows users to authenticate with steam directly to retrieve their steamID?
Potential solution here:

Add some sort of tier/level system to the admin groups, so certain ones can be considered more "senior" than the others, which will then be counted
