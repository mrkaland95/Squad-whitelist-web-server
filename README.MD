# Squad Whitelist Management Server

This is a full stack project that lets admins/owners of a Squad server integrate with discord to allow users store steamIDs, which can then be used for generating permission lists used in-game by a Squad server. These are available through web-endpoints.


Built with:

Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Mongoose/MongoDB

Frontend: To be determined, but likely React or Vue.

Credit to [Ect0s](https://github.com/ect0s) for initial version of this project. This project is meant to be an updated version written in TypeScript and more features.

The project was started anew due to the old repo containing secrets like API keys, and was becoming a bit of a mess, with many dependencies running on quite old versions.
